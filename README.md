### Web Scrapting - Worldwide Steel Suppliers Database

I wanted to create a dataset for steel production around the world that includes suppliers and their information.

I created this dataset using this link: https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-steel-plant-tracker/tracker-map/

First, I exported the table in the link to excel. Next, I created a column with links to the pages of each company in the list. Then, I did web scraping to find "Location, Steel Product Category, Steel Products" information for the suppliers. As a result, I have a dataset containing the basic information of the world's largest steel producing companies and their production sites.

This little work is about a larger project at the company where I worked as a working student. It is aimed to be used in real life.
